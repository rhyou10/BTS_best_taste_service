We sat at the al fresco dining area as the indoor dining area was full, but we had bells to ring for service. It’s on the second storey and look for this sign on the side of the building or you will walk past it. It’s more of a side road that leads off the Main Street.",This tastes amazing! My husband was in Korea for a year with the military and loves bulgolgi. He introduced me to it at a Korean restaurant in Colorado and we have come to really enjoy it.

It has a deep flavor, thanks to the combination of seasonings, hairtail fish and radish. When we get in this hairtail alley, it smells fishy for sure, but this galchi jorim itself doesn't feel dubious thanks to radish and seasonings. Especially radish plays a significant role to get rid of fish smell. Furthermore, when it's cooked well, it is very soft and flavorful. Because radish soaks the seasonings thoroughly.

Instructions are straight forward. Thank you for sharing this,"The best Korean dish I have EVER had has to be galbijjim. It is tender, sweet, and not too salty (depends on how it is prepared).

Lemon and ginger sound like lovely additions to the rich flavour of mackerel.",Definitely worth going to if you’re round the area in Hongdae. What I like about it is that they cook the chicken for you beforehand and that helps to minimize the chances of you getting food poisoning due to raw poultry.Would recommend you to get the cheese set if you love cheese and add in some ramen noodles. The combination is delicious! Before they serve the main dish they will cook you pancakes. The chicken is also served with vegetables (cabbage and sweet potato).

I’ll often throw in other vegetables if I have them – julienne or chopped small. Sooo healthy!",,"We ordered a spicy fried chicken, and after a long wait a basket arrived containing what must be a full chicken - 12 pieces of fresh-fried goodness. They are way beyond KFC but not as otherworldly as I thought them to be. Hope to try another restaurant next time.",Unless you want to eat a whole chicken don't bother.

So here’s Galbi Jjim, a Korean braised short ribs with jujube, pine nuts, chestnuts, ginko, shiitake mushrooms, Korean radish, carrots and Korean pear. It’s quite a lot of ingredients and it took quite a long time to braise the meat but it’s well worth the wait.",,"We ordered ""Original Jokbal"". The food arrived very quickly and frankly it looked good but not much actual flavour. I do not understand how people can say that it is so tasty. It isn't. It is very plain.

I can only imagine how much better it would be on a charcoal grill.,I love this fish!,"For starters, this restaurant was close to our hotel and it was relatively central, although it was slightly tricky to find.

As it only comes in 1 size, with 24 pieces, we could not finish and ask the waitress to pack it up for us","Very disappointed with the fried chicken served. The meat was dried. The spicy chicken was not that spicy at all, The garlic chicken had no taste but bitterness of burned garlic. The salad was old. The service was mediocre. The restaurant was simply using their old flame to lure customers and we were one of them.","I eat Kimchee and hard boiled eggs and drink dark beer when I’m mad at the world and refuse to take prisoners, or when I know I’m going to be pat searched by TSA and I have no pity on them. Fortunately, I am almost never mad at the world, and I don’t fly that much any more.","To be honest, the taste got a bit too one-dimensional once you hit your third or fourth dumpling. The Deep-Fried Mandu was the sole standout.",,,,,,"Everyone loved their orders. The vegetables were fresh, meat well flavoured, sauces offered were flavourful and great accents to the food.  The rice was cooked well and had an interesting purple colour to it.",,,,,,"It's so fresh, full of sea and the gravy goes so well with rice","This Kimchi Stew (Kimchi Jjigae) is loaded with healthy fermented veggies that deliver probiotics to increase the body's immunity.

Simple menu - Korean style fried chicken done with different sauces,"Do you know good food???This place was horrible!But regardless what we ordered we don't believed this mattered.Over battered, some sort of crispy over battered chicken, no skin, no chicken meat. I don't know what cut we paid for but it wasn't real chicken ! It was disgusting! No exaggeration at all! You'll won't believe me, will have to try for yourself It is disgusting.

I'm interested in other reviews","What we normally call kimchi is baechu kimchi (배추김치). It’s one of the tasty ones.

,"I find that oily fish like tuna, mackerel and salmon taste great over an open fire. The tradition of “planking” fish like salmon or shad (a relative of herring” shows how the wood smoke imparts a delicious flavor to these kind of fish that regular cooking, even on a grill, can’t compare to.","Famous for its stir-fried chicken in spicy sauce (Dak Galbi), this restaurant is always very packed whenever we visit. Lucky for us, we are able to get a seat quickly this time. We ordered the mix set which comes in 2 portion - spicy and non-spicy. The spiciness of the spicy version is just right and the non-spicy version is marinated in a sweet sauce. Both taste exceptionally good especially when mixed with the generous amount of cheese.

Potatoes are actually better than meat.",,"The parents, the young niece all love the pig trotters... its tender and you won't feel like its too fatty! ",
,Freshly grilled or fried mackerel is extremely taste.,"Who can resist for mozarella?This restaurant is very famous. If you go to Korea, you must it the chicken dakgalbi with mozarella.

Unless one is very sensitive to sourness, it should not be overwhelming.","I found the basic dumpling filling a bit spicy, which was cut down by the kim-chi on the side.

LOL,The chicken is fried to a nice golden brown and the meat inside is juicy and tender,"In my opinion, yes! But I only enjoy fermented kimchi. To compare it to American foods, it most resembles pickles. Kimchi is salty and has a bit of an acidic tang to it like pickles!

Only thing I might suggest would be to use tender loin steak instead of rib eye as rib eye has quite a bit of fat.,I remember when my mom made this for us for the first time. It was heavenly delicious. I can’t wait to make it for my husband.,This is probably my favorite Korean soup.,,The sweet and spicy flavour combined with the crunchiness is to die for!,The amount and the size of the wings is just nice and it is very yummmy!!,"Kimchi tastes sour, tangy, salty, spicy, and pungent! It’s similar to sauerkraut in that it is fermented cabbage, but kimchi is packed with flavor, umami and a little (or a lot) of heat! The fermentation process is what gives kimchi its sour flavor.","The dumplings are good, but I don't think they live up to the reputation that is advertised. ",,,,,,Absolutely delicious. It has an amazing tender texture and lots of flavor.,,,,,,Perfect for colder weather.,Kimchi stew is an acquired taste. You either like it or you don't--like duran. I can't stand both--sorry.,"It was a bit of a wait and a bit pricey (ngl), but was sososososo good that I almost cried. A silly goofy protip is to go to enhance the flavor and expand your appetite!",,"The pig trotters are (al-dente?), just the right amount of softness and chewiness, bit salty and sour and the garlic is really spicy.",
,"pleasantly spicy but not so hot that you can't enjoy the flavor. I used trout, and it was great on the grill. Be sure to really oil the grill, though - I oiled mine fairly well and the fish still stuck a little bit and I had to loosen it up with a spatula. If you haven't eaten much trout before, trying to avoid the tiny bones is a bit annoying, but the finished product was so tasty that it made up for the extra work.","I came to Seoul without knowing about K-Pop, K-Drama, or even Korean Food, We didn't quite have the motivation to try out restaurants since me and my friend doen't really enjoy Korean food, but this restaurant changed our opinion. The spice doesn't feel tasteless like the other dakgalbi I tasted in my country , we finished the whole wok just the 2 of us.",Bulgogi. This is just Bulgogi. I make it all the time it’s my favourite meal.,"I prepared this grill pork BBQ and steamboat to celebrate my Mid-Autumn Festival with my family on last sat…wow wow wow, they said it is so delicious as we are in korean restaurant and all wanna to eat this dishes.",This was one of my favorite instant soups when I lived in Korea.,,My dad couldn't eat the spicy sauce but loved this sauce,"Best fried chicken in Korea!

Ketchup, BBQ or mustard sauce for the plain fried chicken variety.","it is not just the taste that is provided, but the flavor as well, including every component. Aside from that, you are also provided with the nutritional values and uses of kimchi.",The steam dumpling is excellent and strongly recommend! Huge meat stuffing and thin skin. Lovely. ,,,,,,Bibimbap is perfect for meal prepping.,,,,,,"Although the dish comes out a dark red hue, it’s more savory than sweet and spicy, especially when combined with rice.","Absolutely delicious! At first I was surprised there’s no Gochujang in the recipe, as in the pork version. But this is so light and refreshing, I love it! No need for gochujang at all, the fish and the kimchi balance each other so well.",One of the best dishes I’ve had in a long time!” We love hearing from a satisfied guest,,The meat was really tender and very delicious. ,
,I just caught Atlantic mackerel today. And I'm reading a lot about curing it first with salt and rice vinegar.,"We tried the Chicken Galbi and it was really an excellent experience. Basically they get raw marinated chicken with optional veggies, bulgogi or seafood and cook it on a large pan on your table. Everyone on the table needs to have the same dish as its communal eating and they bill you per head.","I made this with my mom and it was really good, I am a sucker for any kind of Korean style beef! :)",,"I love miyeokguk, so nutritious.",,The chicken is really crunchy and taste so good,"Once you know that you can have only fried chicken, then everything is ok. The taste and the quality of the chicken was good","Though traditional Korean kimchi is not vegan, plenty of these tart and spicy fermented condiments exist in vegan versions. The most satisfying will probably be your own homemade kimchi, which is easier to make than you may realize. An udon noodle stir-fry with vegan kimchi is going to change the way you look at fast, no-frills dinner nights.",,,,,,,Food was terrible and hardly eaten,,,,,,OMG this is the kind of food PW could live on. Belt fish stew with lots of daikons is out of this world,"since it’s cooling tonight, and the kids have been requesting for it, i made them kimchistew with pork, tofu, enoki mushrooms, cabbage, egg and threw in some noodles",Galbijjim is a Korean Traditional braised beef short ribs dish.,,Highly recommend this pig trotters or call Jokbal in Korean. It is super delicious. You will be regret if you don't try it out! My daughter and I love it so much.,
,Taste was a little bland.,the food is ok for korean standard. the place is nice and accommodating. atmosphere is cheerful and waiters know a little english. which helps alot... serving size is ok we are 4 people and ordered 3 serving and it was enough for us..,"Korean beef bulgogi. My wife was always telling her boss at a Korean restaurant that I always wanted very spicy food, and she couldn’t get it spicy enough for me, so Kim made some especially for me, with what she called “a surprise”. Several long red chili peppers (I don’t know what kind) with some extra seasonings. WOW! I never complained about spice, again. It took a quart of milk to flush me out!",,"My kid asks for Miyeok-Guk regularly which always gives me and my wife such a kick! And ever since we've figured out how to use the InstantPot, we can get a deeply satisfying soup going without the long pre-soak or simmering times. My wife likes to saute the beef in sesame oil before getting the soup going. It might not be quite as good but infinitely more working household friendly.",,"This is so yummy! I cannot eat spicy food, but the sauce was delicious <3",It definitely didn't disappoint! The chicken skin was crispy and yet succulent at the same time.,"I really like kimchi! I started to like fermented foods when I was 18, my polish friend introduce me this and i’m also enjoying and doing fermentation like sauerkraut, pickles,beetroot, radish, etc.",,,,,,,All of the ingredients are super healthy and include copious amounts of fresh fruits and vegetables along with red pepper paste and healthy purple rice to all be mixed together.,,,,,,I loved the combination of the fish and radish!,"This is one of my favorite comfort foods. The spicy, warm, flavorful broth can be devoured in just a few minutes",This is Galbi Jjim or braised beef short ribs. This is a soy sauce version which was typically served to kings back in the dynasty days.,,"Best jokbal I've eaten thus far. The proportion of fat to meat per slice was excellent and drizzled with a generous serving of slightly sweet garlic sauce with sesame, this makes the jokbal extremely flavorful and delicious. ",
,This was all a bit strong for me. The glaze was alright but I don't think I realised quite how strong mackerel is. I don't think i'd make it again.,"One of a must eat place in Seoul, Korean loves chicken and cheese ! put it together and you would get spicy chicken fried rice with added mozzarella cheese. The food is cooked right in front of you (and for you), and it is very tasty. The spiciness is just right and it is a delicious meal that can be shared by the table!","I eat Korean food a lot, but the problem is, my meals have little variety. My typical order is the spicy pork Korean Bulgogi, or the spicy squid.",,So delicious. I've had this soup with the sirloin substituted with clam and made it really really good.,,"Korean fried chicken is on another level. It is so crispy, the sauce is so sweet and spicy and I could eat it every day.

You can also add mushrooms of your choice!",,,"Once seated we opted for the variety menu with Garlic jakbol, the classic jakbol and the mustard-y flavoured one and it was delicious!",
,"Quite tasty, but insubstantial. Nothing special.","Our first dakgalbi and we were not disappointed. It had the right amount of spice and the marinated chicken and octopus were yummy. We ordered fried rice and it was added in together with the chicken and octopus. Would have loved to add the cheese but I think it would have been too filling.Best to eat with more people. I went with my 71 year old mom so we wanted to order just for one to share but that wasn’t allowed. In the end we almost managed to finish our food.You could get as much from the salad bar.If you can’t tolerate spice you might not enjoy this. Be warned though, after your food, your hair and clothes will smell of bbq.","For those that are strictly gluten-free, Korean food can present a problem. Bulgogi is the thinly sliced marinated meat used for grilling and fast cooking. It can be beef, pork, or chicken. They all have gluten in them.",,I love this soup when I feel a cold coming on I will make this and feel better the next day...,,This was the best chicken I’ve had with Cass beer.,"Love love love chicken, grew up eating yangyum chicken pretty much every single week, been living in a different country for the last 20 years, with pretty decent fried chicken experience but oh man! This was just simply the best!",I would not like Kimchi because I was taught fermented food is old food; I do not like Sauerkraut altho Sauerkraut is high in Vitamin C; I like Kiefer and Yogurt;,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The braising liquid is beautifully balanced with a slight acidity and a good amount of heat. Hidden beneath the lovely textured fish are large chunks of soft braised radish, which are so good that I would have found the dish just as enjoyable without the fish. ",A little kimchi jigae to warm up after the first round of trick or treating,,,The portion was a good size but was pretty standard tasting jokbal.,
,each time i cook this fish my house is filled with the smell and the actual fish itself smells so strongly i can’t eat it. I’m sure the fish is fresh so I’m not sure what else it could be?,"Chicken galbi with mozzarella cheese is great. Staff can't speak much English and that maybe a factor people think they are rude. But they're not. They try their best. Good food but really spicy. It's around $12 per person, which is well worth it","Delicious, just a little too much ginger.",,I love seaweed soup. I grew up eating it as a kid at my grandmother's who is full korean. My mom made me some after I had my son ecause she said it is supposed to be good for nursing moms. I dont know how much truth there is to it but it made me feel a million times better after being up all night as a first time mommy.,,,Best chicken Ive ever eaten. The mood there is really good. The service is fantastic and the prices are good.,"I don't really like Kimchi, it is one of my least favorite dishes. The reason why I don't like Kimchi is because I find the smell to be rather awkward and I don't really like the taste, Kimchi tastes rather too weird and too spicy for me. I couldn't stand spicy food because my tounge is weak against spicy food and I sometimes have stomachache problem after eating spicy food.",,,,,,,,,,,,,I love this fish stew so much that I make it a mission to at least in once in my trip to Seoul.,"A pot of Kimchi Stew with pork belly cooked using fermented aged Kimchi, you definitely would gobble up two bowls of hot steamed rice....",,,,
